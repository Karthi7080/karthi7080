I’m Karthik Murali, an aspiring Data Analyst passionate about uncovering insights from data to solve real-world problems. With strong skills in Python, data visualization, and statistical analysis, I enjoy turning complex datasets into clear, actionable stories.

I have experience working with tools like Pandas, Streamlit, and SQL to clean, analyze, and visualize data. For example, I built an interactive Valorant Agent Stats Dashboard to help players explore and compare game data dynamically.

In addition to data analysis, I have practical experience in software testing and automation, which enhances my attention to detail and ensures high data quality in all my projects.

I’m eager to apply my skills and grow in the data analysis field, delivering value through data-driven solutions.
